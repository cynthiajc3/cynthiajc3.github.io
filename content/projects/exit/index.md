A Claymation short film about a goofy doodle who finds itself in a dilemma when exiting a building. “Exit” was based on a funny experience that happened to my mother. My goal in making this short film was to share the comedic emotional roller-coaster ride she was on during the incident, one of which many of us find ourselves on unintentionally.

Material & Software – Modeling clay, Wire, Cardboard boxes, Photoshop, and Final Cut Pro.
